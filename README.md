# DevRel Workshop - Golang Instrumentation with New Relic

New Relic for Go monitors your Go language applications and microservices to help you identify and solve performance issues. You can also use your data to improve your customers' experience and make data-driven business decisions. 

In this DevRel workshop, you learn how to instrument Golang apps with New Relic. Go is a compiled language, will require manual instrumentation, and doesnâ€™t use a virtual machine. The best way to monitor Go applications is to use the [Go API](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/go-agent/api-guides/guide-using-go-agent-api), and get started with the official page from New Relic for Golang in [GitHub](https://github.com/newrelic/go-agent). 

With New Relic for Go, you will gain a new level of visibility into your Golang applications:

**See the big picture:**

  - Monitor the throughput, response times, and errors of the transactions in your applications and services.
  - Understand your application's runtime health by seeing memory usage, garbage collection behavior, and CPU usage over time.
  - With deployment markers, see how code changes impact application performance and health.
  - Use infrastructure monitoring to view detailed host and server data.
  - Use distributed tracing to understand how your services and microservices are interacting.

**Identify and fix errors:**

  - Find bottlenecks by seeing time spent on database calls, external system calls, and key blocks of code.
  - View Goroutine counts and identify possible Goroutine leaks.
  - Get alerts for problems or errors before they affect users.
  - Create custom dashboards for important metrics.

**View logs for your APM and infrastructure data:**

You can bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. No need to switch to another UI page.

  - With logs in context, you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI.
  - You can also see logs in context of your infrastructure data, such as Kubernetes clusters.

**Analyze business data:**

  - Query user-related data and improve business processes.
  - Create custom queries of your Go application data.
  - Send your own custom data to New Relic.
  - Create and share visual, interactive displays of your data.
